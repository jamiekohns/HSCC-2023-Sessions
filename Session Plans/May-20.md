## A.I. in programming
- Who has used AI (Chat GPT, etc.)? 
- Used in programming? (how?)

## Keys to Successful Prompts
- GPT is very good at understanding prompts, but you need to be clear and careful
  - When describing code, use 'coding' language:
    - "Use the variable $answer"
    - "Load content into elements with class .card.answer"
    - "Extract the function"
  - Work interavely: 
    - give the AI the the information
    - describe what you want
    - ask for a simple version of what you want
    - ask for increasingly more complex _iterations_

## Design Keys for Success
If you know you need to introduce variables, make sure the base code you supply has accounted for that. 
Otherwise, it will be more diffcult to add in prompts.

Don't expect AI to write your app entirely- especially since we are using a complex framework and an API that the API probably doesn't know about.
